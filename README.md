# Fake Currency Identification Using Deep Learning

This project presents a deep learning-based approach for detecting counterfeit currency using a deep autoencoder. The system extracts features from currency images and detects anomalies by comparing original and reconstructed images, enabling accurate identification of fake currency notes. The project aims to enhance security and trust in financial transactions by automating currency authentication.

## Abstract

Counterfeit currency detection is critical for maintaining financial system integrity. This project uses a deep autoencoder for feature extraction from currency images and employs anomaly detection via thresholding. Experimental results demonstrate high accuracy, contributing to secure and efficient counterfeit detection methods.

***

## Introduction

Counterfeit notes threaten economic stability worldwide. Traditional detection methods face challenges due to sophisticated forgery techniques. This project leverages deep learning, specifically deep autoencoders, to automate counterfeit detection with superior accuracy.

***

## Literature Survey

- Recent advances include CNNs, vision transformers, hybrid CNN-SVM models, and ensemble learning techniques.
- Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and spectral analysis help improve detection robustness.
- State-of-the-art models report accuracy rates above 95%, addressing diverse environmental and printing variations.

***

## Methodology

- **Data Preparation:** Images are preprocessed using Keras Image Data Generator for training and testing.
- **Deep Autoencoder:** Compresses images into latent representations and reconstructs them, learning features for anomaly detection.
- **Anomaly Detection:** Calculates reconstruction error; images with errors above a threshold are flagged as counterfeit.
- **Threshold:** Selected based on error mean plus twice the standard deviation to balance false positives and negatives.

***

## Results

- High accuracy achieved (~87%) with effective anomaly detection.
- Visual comparisons show reconstructed vs. original images highlighting anomalies.
- Model outperforms simple threshold-based baseline methods.

***

## Conclusion and Future Scope

- Deep autoencoder shows promise for counterfeit detection.
- Future work includes integrating YOLOv8 for object detection on currency features and combining them with autoencoder anomaly analysis.
- Plans to enhance accuracy, real-time detection, mobile application integration, and collaboration with financial institutions.
